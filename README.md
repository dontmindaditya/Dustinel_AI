# Dustinel AI

Dustinel AI is a worker safety and health monitoring platform for high-risk job sites.

Workers use a mobile check-in flow to capture face and environment photos at the start of a shift.  
The system analyzes those inputs to detect PPE compliance issues, fatigue indicators, and site hazards, then produces a health risk score.

Based on the score, Dustinel AI classifies risk levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical) and triggers the right response, including real-time alerts for serious conditions.

The platform includes:
- A worker experience for check-ins, personal risk results, and safety recommendations.
- An admin dashboard for live site monitoring, alerts, worker risk trends, and heatmap-based risk visibility across locations.

Overall, the project is built to help teams identify unsafe conditions early and prevent incidents before they happen.
